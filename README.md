# Finding_donors
Finding Donors for charity ML
Description
CharityML is a fictitious charity organization located in the heart of Silicon Valley that was established to provide financial support for people eager to learn machine learning. After nearly 32,000 letters sent to people in the community, CharityML determined that every donation they received came from someone that was making more than $50,000 annually. To expand their potential donor base, CharityML has decided to send letters to residents of California, but to only those most likely to donate to the charity. With nearly 15 million working Californians, CharityML has brought you on board to help build an algorithm to best identify potential donors and reduce overhead cost of sending mail. Your goal will be evaluate and optimize several different supervised learners to determine which algorithm will provide the highest donation yield while also reducing the total number of letters being sent.

This project contains three files:

finding_donors.ipynb: This is the main file where you will be performing your work on the project.
census.csv: The project dataset. You?ll load this data in the notebook.
visuals.py: This Python script provides supplementary visualizations for the project. Do not modify.
In the Terminal or Command Prompt, navigate to the folder containing the project files, and then use the command jupyter notebook finding_donors.ipynb to open up a browser window or tab to work with your notebook. Alternatively, you can use the command jupyter notebook or ipython notebook and navigate to the notebook file in the browser window that opens.
